##Vulnerability Management Project

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in an IT infrastructure. These vulnerabilities can exist in various forms, such as software bugs, misconfigurations, or unpatched systems, and can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal data. 
Vulnerability management is essential to an organization's cybersecurity strategy, focusing on minimizing the attack surface and prevent potential security incidents before they occur. It plays a crucial role in reducing risk and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

Today, Iâ€™ll show how to set up a vulnerability management lab on our home machine using Tenable Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner. While other tools like OpenVAS, Qualys, Rapid7, and Acunetix are also available for vulnerability management, Tenable Nessus is chosen here for its user-friendly and straightforward interface, making it easier for beginners. Understanding the basics with Nessus will provide a solid foundation for grasping more advanced vulnerability management concepts and features. For more advanced capabilities, platforms such as Tenable.io, IBM Security QRadar, and CrowdStrike Falcon can be explored. OpenVAS is available at no cost, while Nessus offers a free version with limited features. For more advanced capabilities, you can opt for the paid versions of Nessus and other tools if needed.

1. Download Nessus from the official website, selecting the version that matches your operating system.

2. Register for Nessus account
4. After completing the setup, you can log in to Nessus.
5. To keep your scans organized, you can create a new folder. Alternatively, you can start a new scan directly by selecting the "New Scan" option in the top right corner.
6. Nessus offers a range of scan types, with some features available only through paid subscriptions. For now, I'll focus on the Basic Scan option. To understand the various scan types in detail, you can refer to the Nessus documentation. Familiarity with these scan types is crucial for effectively meeting your scanning goals.
7. Assign a name and description to your scan, and specify the IP range for the target machines. If you're unsure about the IP range or your private IP address on your network, you can find this information using the command prompt or terminal: ipconfig(Windows) or ifconfig(Mac).
8. Once you have created the scan, you can launch it by clicking the play button next to the scan in the list.
9. After the scan is complete, you can open the scan report to review any vulnerabilities detected.
10. The **Vulnerabilities** tab displays the vulnerabilities found on the machine, categorized by their severity: critical, high, medium, low, or general information. By clicking on a specific vulnerability, you can view detailed information including its description, CVSS score, family, recommended solutions, and references for further study.

Using vulnerability management tools like the Nessus scanner, we can scan our network to identify vulnerabilities, assess their severity, prioritize them, and determine appropriate solutions. For effective vulnerability management, organizations should maintain essential documentation, including vulnerability management policy, assesement procedures, incident response plan, maangement procedures, training and awareness.
